# coding_challenge-19

This coding challenge is all about **Building a React based personal blog using GatsbyJS**. To celebrate the release of the new course [**Complete React Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery**](https://www.udemy.com/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/?couponCode=ZTMLAUNCH) (use coupon code **ZTMLAUNCH**), we are doing an exciting challenge where you will learn how to build a blog using the very popular Gatsby.js!


## What is the Challenge?
Yihua is going to provide free video lessons for you to watch on how to build a blog using Gatsby.js which can be found [**here**](https://www.udemy.com/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/?couponCode=ZTMLAUNCH) (free previewed enabled if you are not signed up for the course so anybody can still watch it!). For those signed up for the course already, you will be able to watch the videos in the last bonus section of your course player. For those not signed up for the course, just click on the promo video and you sill see the videos at the bottom). These videos will only be available for this month only for those not enrolled in the React course. Once you have gone through the video, it is time for you to create your own blog and customize it to your liking. You can even add Dark Mode to your blog using something like this: https://darkmodejs.learn.uno/

At the end of the challenge, we will post everyone's custom blogs down below so make sure you read below for the submission guidelines (In *The Rules Are* section)!

## Submissions:

*Will be posted at the end of the challenge*

## The Rules Are:

1. **You have until July 31st at 11:59pm EST** to submit your solution (using Github. If you don't know how to do that, check out the lecture in the Git + Github section of the course). You will have to submit the link to the **#coding-challenge** Discord group with the following message:  *-challenge URL LINK TO YOUR ENTRY"* . The bot will listen for the command and will reply with "thanks for your submission" if it succeeded.

2. Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, Discord, programming buddy etc...) but I will not be offering any help with this challenge. Just like a developer, you must solve a problem and build something that will be challenging. Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own with your team. 

## One Last Thing!

**Please note: As with all my challenges there is zero benefit or monetary gain I recieve from it. This is just my way of thanking my students and making sure that you are able to continue gaining valuable knowledge outside of just my videos. It would mean a lot to me if you are able to rate my course...5 star reviews make my day :)**
